RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between June 18th and July 17th, 2015. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

As currency exchange rates in South East Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies. The best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up. Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals. USD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible. You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. Travellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. If you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

ATMs are found throughout Southeast Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a backup.  Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible.  You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of an emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time-consuming and tend to have high fees attached. Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items.\r\n\r\nIf you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition.

    "description": "Few travel opportunities are as rare or special as the one to really get out there and explore the must-be-seen-to-be-believed nature and wildlife of the island of Borneo. Start at its heights by summiting UNESCO-designated Mt Kinabalu before descending into the mind-blowing caves of Gunung Mulu National Park. Throw in some unconventional cultural moments like drifting along the water by long boat and overnighting in an Iban longhouse of the Malay people and you've got 16 days of adventure that'll remain with you forever.",

This is often due to the location and type of activities involved (ie high on a mountain and in remote jungle areas). Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\n2. RAMADAN\r\n1. Depending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall sometime between April and June from 2018-2022. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up.  Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible.  You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and  at some larger stores if shopping for big items.\r\n\r\nIf you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted. Be fussy with your bank when buying cash!",

We recommend that you carry a First Aid kit and hand sanitizers / antibacterial wipes as well as any personal medical requirements. Please be aware that sometimes we are in remote areas and away from medical facilities, and for legal reasons our leaders are prohibited from administering any type of drug including headache tablets, antibiotics, etc. In Asia pharmacies tend to stock the same western drugs as you get at home but they are usually produced locally so please bring the full drug name with you when trying to purchase a prescription drug. When selecting your trip please carefully read the brochure and itinerary and assess your ability to cope with our style of travel.

During the trek it is likely that all climbers will experience at least some form of mild altitude sickness. Everyone reacts to altitude differently and altitude sickness can on set with people irrespective of fitness and age. Even the same person can react differently to altitude at different times.\r\n\r\nDanger signs to watch out for: The most common are headaches (although this can also be caused due to dehydration), light-headedness, nausea, loss of appetite, tingling in the extremities (toes, fingers) and a mild swell of ankles and fingers. Communicate any of these symptoms to your guide and follow their advice at all times.\r\n\r\nIf you have severe and consistent symptoms, don't go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. If they do not stop or at least reduce to a manageable level go to a lower altitude and see if your symptoms improve. Keep going down until your symptoms go away completely. \r\n\r\nThere are medications available that help the body increase oxygen levels and reduce the effects of altitude sickness. Always check with your medical professional before using any medication. \r\n\r\nDon't ignore signs of altitude sickness. People can, and have, died of altitude sickness because of a failure to recognize the danger signs.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

These charges are the responsibility of the passengers.\r\n\r\nRAMADAN\r\nAccording to the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between Feb 28th - Mar 29th 2025, and Feb 17th - Mar 19th 2026. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-Muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL WARNINGS TO EASTERN SABAH\r\nVarious nationalities have a travel warning for Eastern Sabah. Please visit your government website and check with your insurance that any warnings will not affect your insurance coverage, as travel insurance that covers the entire itinerary is mandatory on our tours.The safety of our travellers is our number one priority at G Adventures.  We will continuously monitor the region and will continue to run itineraries to areas that we believe to be safe.

        "body": "ACCOMMODATION\r\nIt should be stressed that the nature of the accommodation when compared with other areas of Southeast Asia, is sometimes of a lower standard than normally provided on G Adventures trips. This is often due to the location and type of activities involved (ie high on a mountain and in remote jungle areas). Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that properties we stay in with only two stories may not have elevators installed and climbing the stairs with your luggage will be necessary.\r\n\r\nRAMADAN\r\nAccording to the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between Feb 28th - Mar 29th 2025, and Feb 17th - Mar 19th 2026. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-Muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.\r\n\r\nCOMBO TRIP\r\nPlease note that this tour combines with other G Adventures tours. As such, the staff and some travel companions on your tour may have previously been traveling together with G Adventures, prior to Day 1 of your tour. Likewise, some staff and travel companions may be continuing together on another G Adventures tour, after your trip concludes.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL WARNINGS TO EASTERN SABAH\r\nVarious nationalities have a travel warning for Eastern Sabah. Please visit your government website and check with your insurance that any warnings will not affect your insurance coverage, as travel insurance that covers the entire itinerary is mandatory on our tours. The safety of our travellers is our number one priority at G Adventures.  We will continuously monitor the region and will continue to run itineraries to areas that we believe to be safe.

There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Included breakfasts will usually be asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs.

During the trek it is likely that all climbers will experience at least some form of mild altitude sickness. Everyone reacts to altitude differently and altitude sickness can on set with people irrespective of fitness and age. Even the same person can react differently to altitude at different times.\r\n\r\nDanger signs to watch out for: The most common are headaches (although this can also be caused due to dehydration), light-headedness, nausea, loss of appetite, tingling in the extremities (toes, fingers) and a mild swell of ankles and fingers. Communicate any of these symptoms to your guide and follow their advice at all times.\r\n\r\nIf you have severe and consistent symptoms, don't go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. If they do not stop or at least reduce to a manageable level go to a lower altitude and see if your symptoms improve. Keep going down until your symptoms go away completely. \r\n\r\nThere are medications available that help the body increase oxygen levels and reduce the effects of altitude sickness. Always check with your medical professional before using any medication. \r\n\r\nDon't ignore signs of altitude sickness.

        "body": "ACCOMMODATION\r\nIt should be stressed that the nature of the accommodation when compared with other areas of SE Asia, is sometimes of a lower standard than normally provided on G Adventures trips. This is often due to the location and type of activities involved (ie high on a mountain and in remote jungle areas). Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that properties we stay in with only two stories may not have elevators installed and climbing the stairs with your luggage will be necessary.\r\n\r\nRAMADAN\r\nAccording to the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between sundown on Feb 28th - Mar 29th 2025, and Feb 17th - Mar 19th 2026. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-Muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL WARNINGS TO EASTERN SABAH\r\nVarious nationalities have a travel warning for Eastern Sabah. Please visit your government website and check with your insurance that any warnings will not affect your insurance coverage, as travel insurance that covers the entire itinerary is mandatory on our tours. The safety of our travellers is our number one priority at G Adventures.  We will continuously monitor the region and will continue to run itineraries to areas that we believe to be safe.

ATMs are found throughout Southeast Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up.  Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible.  You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items.\r\n\r\nIf you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition.

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s).

    "description": "Still wild and mysterious even after all these years, Borneo is one of those places that’s become synonymous with adventure travel. Come see what all the fuss is about on this 14-day journey through the Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah. There, you’ll encounter wild orangutans, proboscis monkeys, and other creatures of the rainforest, visit hot springs and waterfalls, and get a better understanding of the local Dayak people by spending the night in a traditional village. Adventure never goes out of style; it just becomes more classic.",

This is often due to the location and type of activities involved (ie high on a mountain and in remote jungle areas). Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\n2. RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between May 27th and June 25th, 2017. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company. There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Included breakfasts will usually be asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs.

ATMs are found throughout Southeast Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up.  Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible.  You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items.\r\n\r\nIf you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition.

Please be aware that sometimes we are in remote areas and away from medical facilities, and for legal reasons our leaders are prohibited from administering any type of drug including headache tablets, antibiotics, etc. In Asia pharmacies tend to stock the same western drugs as you get at home but they are usually produced locally so please bring the full drug name with you when trying to purchase a prescription drug.

During the trek it is likely that all climbers will experience at least some form of mild altitude sickness. Everyone reacts to altitude differently and altitude sickness can on set with people irrespective of fitness and age. Even the same person can react differently to altitude at different times.\r\n\r\nDanger signs to watch out for: The most common are headaches (although this can also be caused due to dehydration), light-headedness, nausea, loss of appetite, tingling in the extremities (toes, fingers) and a mild swell of ankles and fingers. Communicate any of these symptoms to your guide and follow their advice at all times.\r\n\r\nIf you have severe and consistent symptoms, don't go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. If they do not stop or at least reduce to a manageable level go to a lower altitude and see if your symptoms improve. Keep going down until your symptoms go away completely. \r\n\r\nThere are medications available that help the body increase oxygen levels and reduce the effects of altitude sickness. Always check with your medical professional before using any medication. \r\n\r\nDon't ignore signs of altitude sickness.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

RAMADAN\r\nAccording to the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between May 16th and June 14th, 2018. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-Muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

As currency exchange rates in South East Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies. The best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up. Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals. USD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible. You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. Travellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. If you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted. Be fussy with your bank when buying cash!",

Although it may not be customary to you, it is of considerable significance to the people who will take care of you during your travels. There are several times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO will offer to collect the money and tip as a group. Recommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from $1.5-$3.5 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. Also at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job, tipping is appreciated.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables.

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between June 7th to July 7th, 2016. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

As currency exchange rates in South East Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies. The best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up. Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals. USD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible. You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. Travellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. If you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted.

At 4,096m (13,438 ft), Mt Kinabalu is the highest mountain in Malaysia and has been given UNESCO World Heritage Site status. With up to 6,000 species of plants, 326 species of birds, and more than 100 mammalian species identified, it’s easy to understand why. This tour includes some beautiful treks, and the sunrise from Mt Kinabalu’s summit might make you question every other sunrise you’ve witnessed before it. But don’t take our word for it, make sure you see it for yourself.",

This is often due to the location and type of activities involved (ie high on a mountain and in remote jungle areas). Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\nRAMADAN\r\nAccording to the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between Feb 28th - Mar 29th 2025, and Feb 17th - Mar 19th 2026. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-Muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.\r\n\r\nCOMBO TRIP\r\nPlease note that this tour combines with other G Adventures tours. As such, the staff and some travel companions on your tour may have previously been traveling together with G Adventures, prior to Day 1 of your tour.

ATMs are found throughout Southeast Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up.  Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.\r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible.  You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items.\r\n\r\nIf you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition.

We recommend that you carry a First Aid kit and hand sanitizers / antibacterial wipes as well as any personal medical requirements. Please be aware that sometimes we are in remote areas and away from medical facilities, and for legal reasons our leaders are prohibited from administering any type of drug including headache tablets, antibiotics, etc. In Asia pharmacies tend to stock the same western drugs as you get at home but they are usually produced locally so please bring the full drug name with you when trying to purchase a prescription drug.

During the trek it is likely that all climbers will experience at least some form of mild altitude sickness. Everyone reacts to altitude differently and altitude sickness can on set with people irrespective of fitness and age. Even the same person can react differently to altitude at different times.\r\n\r\nDanger signs to watch out for: The most common are headaches (although this can also be caused due to dehydration), light-headedness, nausea, loss of appetite, tingling in the extremities (toes, fingers) and a mild swell of ankles and fingers. Communicate any of these symptoms to your guide and follow their advice at all times.\r\n\r\nIf you have severe and consistent symptoms, don't go higher until you feel better and your symptoms have gone away completely. If they do not stop or at least reduce to a manageable level go to a lower altitude and see if your symptoms improve. Keep going down until your symptoms go away completely. \r\n\r\nThere are medications available that help the body increase oxygen levels and reduce the effects of altitude sickness. Always check with your medical professional before using any medication. \r\n\r\nDon't ignore signs of altitude sickness. People can, and have, died of altitude sickness because of a failure to recognize the danger signs.",

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

Sometimes it can be a small change like adding an extra meal along the itinerary.  Sometimes the change may result in us altering the tour for the coming year.  Ultimately, our goal is  to provide you with the most rewarding experience. Please note that our brochure is usually released in November each year. If you have booked from the previous brochure you may find there have been some changes to the itinerary. \r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Please ensure that you print a final copy of your Trip Details to review a couple of days prior to travel, in case there have been changes that affect your plans.",

This does not affect the activities included and travel times are only minimally altered.\r\n\r\n3. MT KINABALU WARNING\r\nAs advised by Sabah Parks Malaysia we need to warn you that they recommend that you should not climb Mount Kinabalu if you have a history of suffering from the following conditions:\r\n* Heart Disease\r\n* Hypertension\r\n* Chronic Asthma\r\n* Peptic Ulcer\r\n* Severe Anaemia\r\n* Diabetes\r\n* Epileptic fits\r\n* Arthritis\r\n* Palpitations\r\n* Hepatitis (Jaundice)\r\n* Muscular Cramps\r\n* Obesity (over weight)\r\n* Any other sickness that may be triggered by severe cold, exertion and high altitude.\r\nPlease see days 3 - 4 of the trip notes for important notes for climbers on Mount Kinabalu.\r\n\r\n4. COMBO TRIP\r\nPlease note that this tour combines with other G Adventures tours.  As such, the staff and some travel companions on your tour may have previously been traveling together with G Adventures, prior to Day 1 of your tour.  Likewise, some staff and travel companions may be continuing together on another G Adventures tour, after your trip concludes.\r\n\r\n5. LUGGAGE\r\nThere may be a weight restriction for the internal flight on this tour. Each passenger is allowed to carry one checked bag with a maximum weight of 15 kg (33lbs). Additional bags or excess weight charges may apply. These charges are the responsibility of the passengers.\r\n\r\n6. ACCOMMODATION\r\nIt should be stressed that the nature of the accommodation when compared with other areas of SE Asia, is sometimes of a lower standard than normally provided on G Adventures trips. This is often due to the location and type of activities involved (ie high on a mountain and in remote jungle areas). Accommodation is always clean and usually makes up in character and location, what it might not provide in glamour and additional services.\r\n\r\n7. RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between June 7th and July 7th, 2016. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

While not being guides in the traditional sense you can expect them to have a broad general knowledge of the countries visited on the trip, including historical, cultural, religious and social aspects.

It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company.

Included breakfasts will usually be asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs.

As currency exchange rates in South East Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies. The best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up. Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals. USD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible. You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. Travellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached.Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. If you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.

In between all of that excitement, you’ll also have time to enjoy local fare, cruise the Melinau River, and spend time on the tropical island of Pulau Tiga, where you can snorkel, kayak, or simply kick back and catch some rays.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

Planeterra also works to ensure these businesses have a thriving customer base by integrating their projects into G Adventures’ itineraries globally. \r\nG Adventures is Planeterra’s largest corporate donor, covering all operating costs, so 100% of your donation will bring opportunity to people in need.\r\n\r\nG Adventures Dollar-a-day Program - Make Every Day Count - Turn your travel into impact with <a href=\"https://planeterra.org/\">Planeterra Foundation</a>.\r\n\r\nDid you know? Most communities around the world do not benefit from tourism. Give back to the places you visit on your travels by creating opportunities for local people to earn an income, and protect the environment.\r\n\r\nMake every day count by donating $1/day for the length of your trip, and join us in empowering the communities you will visit when you travel. 100% of your donation goes directly to Planeterra projects.",

With few other travellers to contend with, the natural and man-made wonders of this underexplored part of Southeast Asia often feel like they’ve been placed here just for you. And what wonders they are: Inle Lake’s unique floating gardens, the staggering imperial ruins of ancient Bagan, the incomparable palaces of Mandalay, and enveloping forests throughout. Unknown pleasures await — come find them.",

Suitcases are not recommended for G Adventures trips! Most travellers carry a backpack or rolling bag of small to medium size (no XXL ones please!) as they need to fit with you in buses or on trains. You will also need a day pack/bag to carry water, cameras and other electronics like ipods and mobile phones.

This can be exchanged on Day 1 in Yangon with some advice from your CEO. This allowance would cover food, drinks, camera fees and most optional activities (except for the hot air balloon).

We recommend bringing MINT CONDITION US dollars to Burma and exchanging it on arrival. See \"Spending Money\" for more information on budgeting.\r\n\r\nTravellers cheques can be tricky, timely and expensive to exchange. While we do not recommend that you bring them as your primary source of funds, it is great to have one or two cheques in case of emergency. Thomas Cook or American Express travellers' cheques in US currency are the easiest to exchange. Cash advances can also be made with some banks but are time consuming and tend to have high fees attached. Credit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. When purchasing US dollars please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted. Be fussy with your bank when buying cash!",

We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller.

Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use.

A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

Due to customer experience and quality considerations, all services related to the tour must be continuous.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Day 1 is an arrival day and no activities have been planned, so you may arrive at any time. Similarly the last day is a departure day in which no activities are planned.\r\n\r\nYour CEO will contact you at the hotel on Day 1 and make sure you are settled comfortably.

Your CEO will organize a short meeting soon after arrival, during which you will meet other tour participants and receive information about general and specific aspects of the trip.\r\n\r\nWhen arriving to Beijing International Airport, you have a few choices on how to get to your starting point hotel.\r\n\r\nA. Taxi: Follow the signs to the taxi ranks once you have come out of the baggage hall. The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 34-45 minutes depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nB. Airport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can transfer to Subway line 2, or take a taxi from here to your hotel. The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nC. If you have paid for an arrival transfer when you booked your trip, our driver will be waiting for you with a G Adventures sign with your name on it. He/She will be waiting for you outside the luggage hall. There most likely will be many signs, so please check carefully for your name.",

This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns.

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s).

It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

This two-week adventure checks off the must-sees like the Great Wall, Forbidden City, and Xi'an's Terracotta Warriors, but that’s just the start. Journey south to Kunming and discover hidden gems in smaller cities brimming with centuries of history. Wander through Chengdu’s lively People's Park and stroll the charming old towns of Shaxi and Dali. It's the perfect balance of old and new, city and countryside — China like you’ve never experienced before.",

We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change. It is important that you check for yourself with the embassy of each country. Your travel agent can assist. Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA:\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, you may also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before you can apply for your Chinese visa. If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour.

    "description": "Now's the time to explore China on your terms, with this tour that's affordable for young travellers. Over two weeks in China, this tour takes you from Beijing to Hong Kong, revealing China’s contrasts between ancient and modern as you explore both cityscapes and countrysides. There’s a visit to the Great Wall included (naturally), plus the chance to check out the Terracotta Warriors in Xi’an, an overnight stay at the roundhouses in Fujian, and so much more packed into a relatively short trip. This is a great first trip to China that reveals just enough to leave you wanting to come back for more.",

You may also expect some group members to join or leave the tour, between tour segments.\r\n\r\n3. Peak season notice: Golden Week falls between October 1st and 7th, 2019/2020/2021. Please note that Golden Week is a semi-annual 7-day or 8-day national holiday for the people of China. This is a very busy time of the year for domestic tourists, so expect some crowding at major attractions.

It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company. There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Included breakfasts will usually be asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs. Vegetarians will be able to find a range of different foods, although in some areas the choice maybe limited.

If you are able to bring with you a lot of patience, a great sense of humour and a willingness to try and interact with the local people, your travel experience wil be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nChina is a very large country, and this trip covers a lot of ground. There will be multiple overnight trains utilized in order to maximize daylight hours in the places we are visiting. Note that some of these train journeys are quite long, ranging from 14-18 hours. Bring along reading/writing material and other things to pass the time.\r\n\r\nOur overnight train tickets are for beds in the hard sleeper cars. These consist of open bays of six bunks (upper, middle & lower) to one side of the aisle. Bedding is supplied, and berths are padded. There are approximately 60 berths per carriage.\r\n\r\nWe aim to get the best sleeping berths available on each train journey. However, train tickets availability is limited during peak travel times, including summer vacations and Chinese national holidays. As such, it is possible that the group may be separated into different carriages or assigned top sleeping berths.\r\n\r\nTrain travel is often used throughout our China trips as it's an easily accessible and fast way to make the most of the time you have in China. While packing for your trip please note the following restrictions and remember that the local policies in place are for yours and everyone's safety.\r\nProhibited items on China's trains and metro:\r\n1. Any knives or scissors\r\n2. Items or food that have an unpleasant odour (ex. Durian)\r\n3. Open liquor bottles (new bottles with the seal intact are okay)\r\n4. Pressurized/flammable containers over 120ml in size (ex. sunscreen spray, mosquito repellent spray, hairspray, etc.)\r\n\r\nProhibited items on trains to/from Guangxi Province - Guilin/Yangshuo\r\n1.

The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 45min-1hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nAirport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can take a taxi to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nIf you have paid in advance for an arrival transfer, a G Adventures representative will be at the airport to meet you. If for any reason you are not met at the airport, please call our local support line. If you are unable to make contact for whatever reason, please make your way to the joining point hotel via taxi.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Day 1 is an arrival day and no activities have been planned for that day other then your welcome meeting in the evening, so you can arrive at any time.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

Bring along reading/writing material and other things to pass the time.\r\n\r\nOur overnight train tickets are for beds in the hard sleeper cars. These consist of open bays of six bunks (upper, middle & lower) to one side of the aisle. Bedding is supplied, and berths are padded. There are approximately 60 berths per carriage.\r\n\r\nTrain travel is often used throughout our China trips as it's an easily accessible and fast way to make the most of the time you have in China.

Any knives or scissors\r\n2. Items or food that have an unpleasant odour (ex. Durian)\r\n3. Open liquor bottles (new bottles with the seal intact are okay)\r\n4.

The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 45min-1hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT.

This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can take a taxi to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nIf you have paid in advance for an arrival transfer, a G Adventures representative will be at the airport to meet you.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety.

Developing at a fast rate, travel is becoming easier for foreigners but please be aware that English is still not widely spoken outside the large cities and that accommodation, toilet facilities and some transportation is not yet at the same level as you would expect in developed countries.

As currency exchange rates in South East Asia do fluctuate, we ask that you refer to the following website for the most up to date daily exchange rates: www.xe.com for each of the above mentioned currencies. \r\n\r\nThe best way to carry your money is in debit cards, withdrawing cash in local currencies from ATM machines. ATMs are found throughout South East Asia and will generally accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks. It is a great idea to travel with both a Visa and Mastercard if at all possible in case of loss or problems with one card, you will have a back up. Please note, your bank will charge a fee for overseas withdrawals. \r\n\r\nUSD Cash is recommended for times when ATMs are not accessible. You should bring some cash with you for emergency situations (please refer to our trip dossier) but carrying only cash is a high safety risk. ATM card/s and some cash is the ideal mix. \r\n\r\nCredit cards can be used at some upmarket restaurants, and at some larger stores if shopping for big items. If you are bringing US Dollars, please make sure that the notes are new and in good condition. Notes older than 2003, or with any tears or blemishes may not be accepted. Be fussy with your bank when buying cash!\r\n\r\nCash (Chinese Yuan) is the best method of money in China. There are some ATM machines at international airports and major cities that accept Visa and debit cards but these should not be relied on as a source of funds. We recommend the use of cash in major currencies (USD, CAD, GBP, EUR, AUD, HKD) as a backup. Major credit cards are accepted in a few shops (except for AMEX and Diner's) but they may charge a 2-4% transaction fee.",

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables.

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 45min-1hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nAirport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can take a taxi to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nIf you have paid in advance for an arrival transfer, a G Adventures representative will be at the airport to meet you. If for any reason you are not met at the airport, please call our local support line. If you are unable to make contact for whatever reason, please make your way to the joining point hotel via taxi.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Day 1 is an arrival day and no activities have been planned for that day other then your welcome meeting in the evening, so you can arrive at any time. Similarly the last day is a departure day during which no activities have been planned.\r\n\r\nA G Adventures Representative will organize a short meeting soon after arrival, during which you will meet other tour participants and receive information about general and specific aspects of the trip.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 45min-1hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nAirport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can take a taxi to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nIf you have paid in advance for an arrival transfer, a G Adventures representative will be at the airport to meet you. If for any reason you are not met at the airport, please call our local support line. If you are unable to make contact for whatever reason, please make your way to the joining point hotel via taxi.\r\n\r\nPlease note that Day 1 is an arrival day and no activities have been planned for that day other then your welcome meeting in the evening, so you can arrive at any time.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s).

It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company. There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Breakfast in China will usually be Asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs. Vegetarians will be able to find a range of different foods, although in some areas the choice maybe limited.

Hike the huge (and hugely gorgeous) Tiger Leaping Gorge, explore ancient villages, and stroll the streets of the Ming-influenced old city of Dali. This is China, unfiltered.",

There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Included breakfasts will usually be asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs.

Giving a tip should be a seen as a formal 'thank you', and the action should in no way be awkward. The best method of tipping someone that has served the whole group is to plan in advance, and not rush when it comes to saying goodbye. You may do this individually, or your CEO will offer to collect the money and tip as a group. Recommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from $1-$2 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). Also at the end of each trip if you feel your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job, tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $20-25 USD per person, per week can be used.",

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent. It is your own responsibility to have the correct travel documentation. Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change. It is important that you check for yourself with the embassy of each country. Your travel agent can assist. Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA:\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, you may also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before you can apply for your Chinese visa. If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while Hong Kong is part of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a Special Administrative Regions (SAR), it has separate entry requirements. For your visa application, please only use the dates you enter or exit mainland China.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time.

Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent. It is your own responsibility to have the correct travel documentation. Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change. It is important that you check for yourself with the embassy of each country. Your travel agent can assist. Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA:\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, you may also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before you can apply for your Chinese visa. If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

A minimum coverage of USD200,000 is required. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, cancellation,  curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects. Some tours include adventure activities that require extra coverage (e.g. crampon use); please review your itinerary and make sure that you are covered for all included activities.

Featuring tatami floors (soft mats of woven straw), futon beds, Japanese-style baths, cotton kimono (casual robe worn to lounge around or to head to the bath), and elaborate meals (often served in the comfort of your own room), a ryokan is the perfect place to experience traditional customs and hospitality. As ryokan are usually top tier accommodations, most guests stay only one night, often to celebrate a special occasion or holiday. Don’t be intimidated by the formalities inherent to a stay at a ryokan, your hosts will welcome you the same way they do all their guests. Have fun and enjoy this relaxing opportunity to learn more about Japan’s unique customs. \r\n\r\nMinshuku are Japan’s answer to the Western bed and breakfast. Similar to ryokan, they have traditional features like tatami floors, futon beds, and Japanese-style baths. Minshuku are often family-run, and as such they offer a great opportunity to interact with local people and learn more about the nation’s customs. More affordable and simpler than ryokan, minshuku tend to have smaller guestrooms, shared bathroom facilities, and any included meals (traditional, local, and delicious) are served in a communal dining room.\r\n\r\nPlease note that some of the traditional Japanese inns used on this tour only offer shared bathing facilities. This means that individual shower stalls will not be available, instead several shower stations are available in an open, same-sex bathing area. Shared bathhouses and onsen (hot springs) are an essential part of Japan’s culture, traditionally serving as a place for men or women to gather, relax, and discuss the days happenings.",

        "body": "It’s essential to pack as lightly as possible for rail travel in Japan. All G Adventures tours use the world-famous Shinkansen bullet trains, which have a restriction on maximum luggage size.\r\n\r\nAny luggage brought on board must be less than 160cm in total (calculated as the sum of the height + width + depth of your luggage). This is roughly the size that most airline companies consider as \"carry-on baggage\" and allow in overhead storage compartments. We strongly recommend bringing a day pack or backpack to use during the day (for daily essentials like water, cameras, passport, etc.).\r\n\r\nPlease note that travellers who bring luggage that exceeds this restriction will be directly penalized by the Central Japan Railway Company. Any luggage between 160–250cm will require a fee of 1,000 JPY per luggage, for each leg of your train journey, and is strictly subject to availability. Any luggage over 251cm in total is prohibited on the Shinkansen trains.\r\n\r\nIf you absolutely must bring more than what fits into a single carry-on bag plus day pack, you may bring a second carry-on bag which also must be less than 160cm in total. Please note, however, that as with all G Adventures tours, you must be able to carry your luggage unassisted.\r\n\r\nAs a rule we try not to have to walk more than 15-20 mintues with your bags which is why we recommend keeping the weight of your bags between 10-15kg/22-30lb. Suitcases are not recommended for G Adventures trips! Most travellers carry a backpack or rolling bag of small to medium size (no XXL ones please!) as they need to fit under the beds when travelling on sleeper trains. You will also need a day pack/bag to carry water, cameras and other electronics like ipods and mobile phones.\r\n\r\nDo not bring any knives or swords into China (gifts or otherwise). If they do make it into the country, they will not be permitted on trains. If you purchase a knife or sword while travelling elsewhere before arriving in China your best option is to post/mail it home before entering the country as no post/mail companies in China will accept it as a parcel. \r\n\r\nTakuhaibin - Japan’s takuhaibin service is a convenient and reliable way to transfer luggage from one location to another throughout the country. Pick-up/drop-off/delivery dates and times can be easily scheduled (usually overnight) and costs are moderate. Service can be arranged at most hotels and airports. Using Takuhaibin to send your luggage between hotels, or from hotel to airport, is a great way to travel light and avoid hauling large bags on crowded trains or up and down stairs – just be sure to pack an overnight bag with everything you’ll need until you’re reunited with your luggage the following day.",

Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA:\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, you may also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before you can apply for your Chinese visa. If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour. These are required for entry & exit stamps.",

If you are able to bring with you a lot of patience, a great sense of humour and a willingness to try and interact with the local people, your travel experience wil be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nDue to Internet restrictions, some popular websites and applications – including social media sites like Facebook and email services like Gmail – may not work in China.

The most common payment methods are through apps such as Wechat Pay and Alipay. Therefore, we strongly suggest setting up either Wechat or Alipay on your device prior to coming to China. This will require you link a credit or debit card to these apps and also set up a data roaming package to use in China so that you can make payments locally.  Please check the terms and conditions carefully when you set up account and payment. Credit cards may work with big venders in first tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong but it's not guaranteed and less likely to work in other cities or towns and small venders.\r\n\r\nCredit Cards are widely accepted throughout Japan, but some places still only accept cash. Money can be exchanged at Post Offices and some banks and hotels in major cities, however it can be a very slow process. Every Post Office and Convenience store has an ATM machine that accepts Visa, Mastercard and Debit Cards.

You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group. \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). Also at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use.

A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns.

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent. It is your own responsibility to have the correct travel documentation. Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change. It is important that you check for yourself with the embassy of each country. Your travel agent can assist. Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA:\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, you may also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before you can apply for your Chinese visa. If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China.

You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour.

Take in all the classic landmarks of China – the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Warriors – before hopping a flight from Shanghai to Kunming so you can immerse yourself in the culture of Yunnan. (Spicy food lovers, take note – this place is heaven for cuisine.) Hiking Tiger Leaping Gorge will remain a bragging right for years to come. Whether it’s your first time in China or one of many return trips, we’ll make sure you see something new.",

Taxi:  Follow the signs to the taxi ranks once you have come out of the baggage hall.  The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi.  Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese.  A taxi ride will take 1 hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway).  \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT.  THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF.  \r\n\r\nB.  Airport Express Train:  Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line.  This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can transfer to Subway line 2, or take a taxi from here to your hotel.  The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan.  It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen.  Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm.  \r\n\r\nTo continue to the Chongwenmen Hotel by subway, it is very easy to transfer to Line 2 of the Subway and take it 5 stops to the Chongwenmen stop.  Exit C.  Turn right.  The hotel is on your right hand side. Subway Fare is 2 yuan.\r\n\r\nC.  If you have paid for an arrival transfer when you booked your trip, our driver will be waiting for you with a G Adventures sign with your name on it.

The best method of tipping someone that has served the whole group is to plan in advance, and not rush when it comes to saying goodbye.

Recommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from $1-$2 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s).

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company. There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip. Breakfast in China will usually be Asian style consisting of noodles or congee (rice porridge) or bread and eggs. Vegetarians will be able to find a range of different foods, although in some areas the choice maybe limited. While trekking in remote regions food is included, plentiful and made of fresh local ingredients.

While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller.

Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while Hong Kong is part of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a Special Administrative Regions (SAR), it has separate entry requirements.

The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves.

This 24-day tour of China includes both — and then some. Monumental sights like the Great Wall, Forbidden City, and an army of Terracotta Warriors can make China seem intimidating — but with an expert CEO (Chief Experience Officer) leading the way, we’ll wipe away those worries and leave you free to enjoy the ride. And between the panda conservation centre, bamboo rafting, beaches, historic sites, tai chi, and lively nightlife, it’s not a ride you’ll want to miss.",

Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent. It is your own responsibility to have the correct travel documentation. Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\n** Please be advised that if you have recently travelled to Turkey, or you are a Turkish citizen, it is possible that your Chinese visa will not be approved. Please contact your local embassy for further information. **\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change. It is important that you check for yourself with the embassy of each country. Your travel agent can assist. Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA: all nationalities require a visa to visit China\r\n\r\nMost nationalities also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before they can apply for their Chinese visa.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\n\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nAs of April 3rd, 2018, all Chinese visa application forms must be typed. Handwritten forms will no longer be accepted.\r\n\r\nFollowing the successful implementation of their 144 hour visa free program for the Shanghai district, The Ministry of Public Security of China have announced the extension of the 144 hour visa free program for provinces of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei.

Pre-arrival registration is not required for Indian nationals in direct transit by air and not leaving the airport transit area.  An Indian national can make use of the online service to apply for pre-arrival registration free of charge if he/she:\r\n\r\n- Holds an Indian passport valid for at least six months; and\r\n\r\n- Intends to visit or transit (except in direct transit by air and not leaving the airport transit area) in Hong Kong for a stay not exceeding 14 days.\r\n\r\nInformation accurate as of December, 2018.\r\n\r\nLink to Indian pre-arrival registration: https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/pre-arrival_registration_for_indian_nationals.html",

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

Should breakfast not be included, your CEO can suggest some local options. \r\n\r\nTravelling with G Adventures you experience the vast array of wonderful food that is available out in the world. Generally meals are not included in the trip price when there is a choice of eating options, to give you the maximum flexibility in deciding where, what and with whom to eat. It also gives you more budgeting flexibility, though generally food is cheap. Our groups tend to eat together to enable you to taste a larger variety of dishes and enjoy each other's company. There is no obligation to do this though. Your CEO will be able to suggest favourite restaurants during your trip.  While trekking in remote regions food is included, plentiful and made of fresh local ingredients.\r\n\r\nFor all trips please refer to the meals included and budget information for included meals and meal budgets.",

This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\n** Please be advised that if you have recently travelled to Turkey, or you are a Turkish citizen, it is possible that your Chinese visa will not be approved. Please contact your local embassy for further information. **\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change.

The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nWhen filling out your Chinese Visa Application form, Please ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\n\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nAs of April 3rd, 2018, all Chinese visa application forms must be typed.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent. It is your own responsibility to have the correct travel documentation. Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller. The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change. It is important that you check for yourself with the embassy of each country. Your travel agent can assist. Please, keep in mind that all countries require passports valid for at least 6 months from the moment of departure from the country.\r\n\r\nCHINA:\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, you may also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before you can apply for your Chinese visa. If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China.

You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour.

We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller.

The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

This comprehensive 26-day journey from Beijing to Tashkent is one of those experiences that will stay with you for a lifetime. Picking up in the Chinese capital, you’ll visit the Uyghur province of Xinjiang, learning about the food, culture and history of this minority group. Then, we’ll leave China behind and venture into Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to retrace part of the route that helped build empires: The Silk Road. From stunning snow-capped mountains to arid deserts, experience a side of Asia in a way that you’ll barely believe is real.",

Additional bags or excess weight charges may apply. These charges are the responsibility of the passengers.\r\n\r\n2. RAMADAN\r\nDepending on the lunar cycle, Ramadan will fall between June 18th to July 17th, 2015. Please note that Ramadan is a month of fasting observed by Muslims throughout the world, during which time the followers of Islam should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. There may be some limitations to services and disruptions to schedules during Ramadan in Muslim areas, but generally our tours still operate effectively during this period and food is available to non-muslims throughout the day. It is very important to display increased cultural sensitivity during Ramadan. Please wear loose fitting clothes, that cover knees and shoulders, and try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public out of respect for those who can't at that time.",

Taxi: Follow the signs to the taxi ranks once you have come out of the baggage hall. The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 34-45 minutes depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nB. Airport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can transfer to Subway line 2, or take a taxi from here to your hotel. The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. To continue to the Chongwenmen Hotel by subway, it is very easy to transfer to Line 2 of the Subway and take it 5 stops to the Chongwenmen stop. Exit C. Turn right. The hotel is on your right hand side. Subway Fare is 2 yuan. \r\n\r\nC. If you have paid for an arrival transfer when you booked your trip, our driver will be waiting for you with a G Adventures sign with your name on it.

Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent. It is your own responsibility to have the correct travel documentation. Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nUZBEKISTAN: all nationalities require a visa to visit Uzbekistan.\r\n\r\nMost nationalities also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before they can apply for their Uzbekistan visa. \r\n\r\nNoted Exemptions: Citizens of the following countries do not require an LOI to apply for a tourist visa valid up to 30 days: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom.  Those who don't need an LOI can leave the \"Invite Party\" on their visa application form blank.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in Uzbekistan. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details. Please note that we also require a 3x4cm. scanned passport photo which can be emailed to your G Adventures Representative or Agent upon confirmation. \r\n\r\nThe documents you will need to obtain your visa:\r\n1) A standard application form from the embassy or consulate where you want to collect your visa\r\n2) Two passport sized photos (note it is sometimes better for women to have their head covered in a head scarf, but it is not obligatory)\r\n3) Payment for the visa depends on nationality and sometimes needs to be made at a local nearby bank.\r\n4) Passport with empty pages\r\n5) Uzbekistan Letter of Invite\r\n6) Letter of Employment\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN UZBEKISTAN LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\n\r\nInput your name the same way it is in your passport. The Uzbekistan MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) is very precise about the information on the application form and it must match your passport (if you have 2 or more names - all of them have to be listed under \"first name\"). \r\n\r\nAs Uzbekistan visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates. We also recommend you add on an extra day to both the start/end of your trip so your visa length will cover any unexpected delays. Please, remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Uzbekistan embassy.\r\n\r\nThe Uzbekistan Government has implemented a new requirement asking passengers to provide a Letter of Employment (LOE) in order to issue the Letter of Invitation (LOI) Please make sure to attach this LOE to your LOI application below as both are required to begin this process. If you are retired, please attach a typed letter advising when you officially retired (you may be contacted by us to follow up with you for more information if necessary)\r\n\r\nIf your country has an official Uzbekistan Consulate/Embassy, you must choose this as as your 'Visa pick up location', if you do not see a local consulate/embassy on this list or you are unable to go there due to prior travel arrangements, please contact your travel agent or G Adventures for further assistance. Certain nationalities may be able to obtain a visa upon arrival at Tashkent airport, but this is for special circumstances only and you must make sure to check with your embassy if this applies for your nationality, before choosing this option.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit your application until 3 months prior to your entry into Uzbekistan. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in Uzbekistan, As an Uzbekistan visa is only valid for 90 days once it is issued, you will be emailed your Uzbekistan invitation Letter only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.  \r\n\r\nPlease Note: As the Visa Authorization Number is issued by the Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs - unexpected delays can occur and this process can not be rushed.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the Uzbekistan embassy you listed in the online application. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct. \r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nKYRGYSTAN: Most nationalities  do not require a Visa to enter Kyrgystan for up to 60 days.\r\n\r\nThese include: USA, Canada, Australia, Austria, Belgium, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Finland, France, Sweden, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Switzerland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Greece, Portugal, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta, Croatia, Czech Republic, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Monaco, Vatican, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Kingdom of Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Qatar\r\n\r\nPlease ensure you check with your nearest consulate/embassy for most up to date details.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCHINA: all nationalities require a visa to visit China\r\n\r\nMost nationalities also need an official Letter Of Invitation (LOI) before they can apply for their Chinese visa. \r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China.

We will provide you with the necessary documents to obtain your Chinese Visa, please use the details provided when filling out your Chinese Visa application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\n\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China.

This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\nPlease note that visas are the responsibility of the individual traveller.

The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

Accommodation in western Tibet (particularly at Everest Base Camp) is extremely basic - only multishare rooms may be available and little or no running water. Basic pit toilets. 3. The sun is intense - hat and sun screen are essential as well as drinking plenty of water as altitude exacerbates dehydration.\r\n\r\n2. DRONES IN NEPAL\r\nPlease note that drones and the flying of drones are prohibited in Nepal. If you violate these regulations the police may take you into custody.\r\n\r\n3. ACCOMMODATION\r\nAccommodation in western Tibet (particularly at near Everest Base Camp) is extremely basic - only multishare rooms may be available and little or no running water. Basic pit toilets.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that properties we stay in with only two stories may not have elevators installed and climbing the stairs with your luggage will be necessary.\r\n\r\n4. WEATHER\r\nThe sun is intense - hat and sun screen are essential as well as drinking plenty of water as altitude exacerbates dehydration.\r\n\r\nChina:\r\n1. Please note while traveling through mainland China you will not be able to access some popular internet websites. It’s important to let your family and friends know that you might not be able to stay in touch over your usual methods, be it – social media or email. The Chinese Government restricts certain websites such as Google, Dropbox, Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WordPress, Whatsapp etc. It may be possible to still access some of these websites using a VPN. If you wish to stay in touch with your friends and family through the above blocked sites, we suggest you research installing a suitable VPN on your device prior to travel or turn on your data roaming if needed.\r\n\r\n2.

If you require a Letter of Invitation (LOI) to apply for a Chinese visa, please fill out & submit the following request <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/visa-forms/China/'>form</a>\r\n\r\nYou can obtain the LOI through our visa support agent in China. The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nYou must print out the full set of application forms including the ‘Confirmation of Online Visa application’ and ‘Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China’. All pages of each form must be printed out. The signature and date on the Confirmation Page and the 8th page of Visa Application Form of the People's Republic of China must be handwritten by the applicant themselves. Visa applicants under the age of 18 must be signed by their guardian while also adding a handwritten signature in the ‘For person filling in the application on the applicant’s behalf’.\r\n\r\nTravellers must have at least two blank passport pages available for each country they will visit on your tour. These are required for entry & exit stamps.\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nTIBET:\r\nAs Tibet continues to be a sensitive area for travel to the Chinese government, you must refrain from listing Tibet as one of the places you are going to visit as your application form or your Visa will be denied.\r\nIf you require a visa to enter China, G Adventures will provide you with the necessary documents to obtain your Chinese Visa, as per the China section above. Once you receive your Chinese Visa, please send a copy of this to experience@gadventures.com so we can arrange your Tibet permit.\r\n\r\nWe must receive your China Visa copy no later than 31 days prior to departure, to ensure your Tibet permit can be obtained in time.\r\nIf you do not require a visa to enter China, we will require a coloured copy of the passport you will be travelling on. We highly encourage you provide this as early as possible, but no later than 31 days prior to departure.\r\n\r\nThe above information relates to the following tours:\r\nACLK - Essential Tibet\r\nACXK - Best of China & Tibet\r\n\r\n********************\r\n\r\nNEPAL:\r\nNepal is now offering e-Visas for some nationalities. please visit this <a href=\"https://www.immigration.gov.np/page/tourist-visa/\"> link </a> for further information, and to check if your nationality is eligible for an e-Visa. You can apply for the visa <a href=\"https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/onlinevisa-mission/application\"> here </a>. Please also be advised that you should bring a passport photo with you in case you need it.\r\nWe strongly suggest travellers eligible for an e-Visa complete that online before arrival to Nepal to ease your entry and avoid queuing. Visa's are available upon arrival at the airport for those who are unable to receive their e-Visa beforehand.",

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning.

Taxi: Follow the signs to the taxi ranks once you have come out of the baggage hall. The ranks are clearly defined, and traffic guards will systematically put you into a taxi. Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 45min-1hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nB. Airport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can take a taxi to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nC. If you have paid for an arrival transfer when you booked your trip, our driver will be waiting for you with a G Adventures sign with your name on it. He will be waiting for you outside the luggage hall. There most likely will be many signs, so please check carefully for your name.\r\n",

If they do make it into the country, they will not be permitted on trains.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use.

A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk.\r\n\r\nWe take all prudent measures in relation to your safety.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables.

While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\n\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nAs of April 3rd, 2018, all Chinese visa application forms must be typed. Handwritten forms will no longer be accepted.\r\n\r\nFollowing the successful implementation of their 144 hour visa free program for the Shanghai district, The Ministry of Public Security of China have announced the extension of the 144 hour visa free program for provinces of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. As of the 29th of December 2017, over 50 foreign nationals can now enter or exit via one of the following ports:\r\n\r\n- Beijing Capital International Airport \r\n- Railway West Railway Station\r\n- Tianjin Binhai International Airport\r\n- Tianjin International Cruise Homeport, or \r\n- Shijiazhuang Zhengding International Airport in Hebei Province and Qinhuangdao Harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONG KONG: all Indian nationalities require a 'pre-arrival registration' to enter Hong Kong\r\n\r\nIndian nationals must apply for and successfully complete pre-arrival registration online before they can visit or transit the Hong Kong.  Pre-arrival registration is not required for Indian nationals in direct transit by air and not leaving the airport transit area.  An Indian national can make use of the online service to apply for pre-arrival registration free of charge if he/she:\r\n\r\n- Holds an Indian passport valid for at least six months; and\r\n\r\n- Intends to visit or transit (except in direct transit by air and not leaving the airport transit area) in Hong Kong for a stay not exceeding 14 days.\r\n\r\nInformation accurate as of December, 2018.\r\n\r\nLink to Indian pre-arrival registration: https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/pre-arrival_registration_for_indian_nationals.html",

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline $5 USD per person per day can be used.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewellery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your CEO has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it is deemed necessary due to safety concerns. Your CEO will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy or explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.  Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night.  It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s).

Print out the name of your hotel in Chinese. A taxi ride will take between 45min-1hour depending on traffic, and should cost between 95-120 Yuan (plus an extra 10 for the tollway). \r\n\r\nDO NOT GO WITH ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU OFFERING A METERED TAXI WHICH IS PARKED IN THE LOT. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. \r\n\r\nB. Airport Express Train: Once you have come out of the luggage hall, follow the signs to the underground Airport Express Line. This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can transfer to Subway line 2, or take a taxi from here to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nC.

Please use your own good judgment when selecting an activity in your free time.

It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nProtests and Demonstrations- Protests and demonstrations, even those that are well intended, have the potential to turn violent with no warning. Counter protests can also turn violent. Action by security forces to disperse demonstrators and protesters may occur at any time.  If you are in an area where demonstrators or protesters are gathering, avoid the temptation of staying for a good photo opportunity and leave the area immediately.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards) have a balanced approach to safety.

Visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as far as possible, but rules do change and sometimes without warning. While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check the information yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\r\n\r\nVisa information specific to your destination and nationality can be found in our Important Pre-Departure Information page <a href='https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/prepare-for-your-tour/'>here</a>\r\n\r\n** Please be advised that if you have recently travelled to Turkey, or you are a Turkish citizen, it is possible that your Chinese visa will not be approved.

The visa requirements for your trip vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. We keep the following information up to date as much as possible, but rules do change.

The visa support link you need to complete will be sent to you or your travel agent by email when you confirm your booking. You must read the instructions carefully and fill out all the details.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you list the same details as appear on your LOI when filling out your Chinese Visa Application form.\r\n\r\nHOW TO FILL IN CHINA LOI FORM ONLINE:\r\n\r\nAs Chinese visas are dated specifically for entry and exit, please ensure you enter the correct dates as per your flights entering and exiting China. Please remember to put exactly the same dates when you fill out the application at the Chinese embassy. You will need to provide additional documentation to the consulate (i.e. flights tickets, hotel reservations) if these dates fall outside the duration of the tour.\r\n\r\nPlease do not submit the below application until 3 months prior to your entry into China. The details will be forwarded to our local agent in China and you will be emailed your Chinese Invitation Letter (With day by day Itinerary) only once we are within 60 days of the trip start date.\r\n\r\nOnce you have received your LOI you can apply for your visa by going to the nearest Chinese embassy. Please, remember that it is your responsibility to check whether passport details, name spelling and dates on the LOI are correct.\r\n\r\nAs of April 3rd, 2018, all Chinese visa application forms must be typed. Handwritten forms will no longer be accepted.\r\n\r\nFollowing the successful implementation of their 144 hour visa free program for the Shanghai district, The Ministry of Public Security of China have announced the extension of the 144 hour visa free program for provinces of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei.

There are times during the trip where there is opportunity to tip the local guides or drivers we use. You may do this individually, or your CEO may offer to collect the money and tip as a group.  \r\n\r\nRecommendations for tipping drivers and local guides would range from 1 to 3 USD per person per day depending on the quality and length of the service; ask your CEO for specific recommendations based on the circumstances and culture. A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation. This method brings the action out into the open, allowing for a friendly and appreciative interaction between the group and the recipient(s). \r\n\r\nAlso at the end of each trip if you felt your G Adventures CEO did an outstanding job tipping is appreciated.

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure.

Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them.

    "description": "China is a great example of a country with equally modern and historic relevance, and with this 19-day tour you’ll learn why. By crossing the country via train you’ll not only be able to visit a bunch of different cities (and Hong Kong!) in just under three weeks, but you’ll also get to see the diverse landscapes that make up the world’s most populous country. Stand face-to-face with the Terracotta Warriors, cycle the ancient city walls, practice Tai Chi with locals, go shopping in Shanghai, or sing your heart out in a karaoke session. If you’re feeling adventurous, do it all.",

We recommend that you check your government's advice for their latest travel information before departure. We strongly recommend the use of a neck wallet or money belt while travelling, for the safe keeping of your passport, air tickets, travellers' cheques, cash and other valuable items. Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage. When travelling on a group trip, please note that your group leader has the authority to amend or cancel any part of the trip itinerary if it deemed necessary, due to safety concerns. Your Chief Experience Officer (CEO) will accompany you on all included activities. During your trip you will have some free time to pursue your own interests, relax and take it easy and explore at your leisure. While your CEO will assist you with options available in a given location, please note that any optional activities you undertake are not part of your itinerary, and we offer no representations about the safety of the activity or the standard of the operators running them. Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time. Although the cities visited on tour are generally safe during the day, there can be risks to wandering throughout any major city at night. It is our recommendation to stay in small groups and to take taxis to and from restaurants, or during night time excursions.\r\n\r\nWater based activities have an element of danger and excitement built into them. We recommend only participating in water based activities when accompanied by a guide(s). We make every reasonable effort to ensure the fun and adventurous element of any water based activities (in countries with varying degrees of operating standards), have a balanced approach to safety. It is our policy not to allow our CEOs to make arrangements on your behalf for water based activities that are not accompanied by guide(s).\r\n\r\nSwimming, including snorkeling, is always at your own risk. <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.com/travel-resources/safety//\">Read more about travel safety</a> for ways to further enhance your personal safety while traveling.",

A minimum coverage of USD200,000 is required. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, cancellation,  curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects. Some tours include adventure activities that require extra coverage (e.g. crampon use); please review your itinerary and make sure that you are covered for all included activities.

This line takes you to the center of Beijing, to DONGZHIMEN, where you can take a taxi to your hotel(taxi fare is about 30 yuan). The Airport Express ticket costs 25 yuan. It takes about 16 minutes from Terminal 3 of the Airport to Dongzhimen. Train hours are from 6:30am to 10:30pm. \r\n\r\nIf you have paid in advance for an arrival transfer, a G Adventures representative will be at the airport to meet you.

A suggestion would be for each group member to contribute anonymously by putting their tip into an envelope. This often works the best and the group as a whole should gather to present the gift to the recipient(s), offering their thanks and showing their appreciation.

Leave your valuable jewelery at home - you won't need it while travelling. Many of the hotels we use have safety deposit boxes, which is the most secure way of storing your valuables. A lock is recommended for securing your luggage.

Please use your own good judgement when selecting an activity in your free time.
